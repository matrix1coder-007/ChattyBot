The OFFICE NICHE: It is an Assistant Bot for every individual of the company. It keeps a record for the Attendance, Geo-location marked for attendance, timesheet tasks accomplished during the office and many more AI based stuff taking voice-input and voice-output too.

In this application, the basic insight is to combine the features of Skype and MS Teams to have a chatbot system that works on NLP, voice trigger input/output and text to speech and speech to text conversions.
The features shortlisted from the likes of Skype + MS Teams + Whatsapp are:
1.	FRS: Facial Recognition System based Sign-IN/Sign-OUT
2.	Group/Chat rooms: Group/Individual messages
3.	Video Call
4.	Non-Video call
5.	Chat Messages
6.	Message audio recorder
7.	Message video recorder
8.	Text editor
9.	Geo-tagging/location
10.	Schedule a call
11.	Create a poll
12.	Notifications
13.	Activity log report
14.	Add/remove contacts
15.	Search a word
16.	Gallery
17.	File sharing system
18.	Departmental teams: Broadcast messages
19.	Calendar: Schedule meetings
20.	Shifts
21.	Notes
22.	Approvals
23.	Task planner and to-do list
24.	Bookings 
25.	Help section
26.	**The gossip section (: non-office communication; something that is irrelevant to office work)
                                                                                                         
The design features to be provided in the application resemble mostly the following:
1.	Every user gets a username and password to login into the application and can see their relevant channels.
2.	Essentially for login, they’ll be showing their face and FRS be done on their photo… to verify their identity.
3.	Departmental channels: Broadcast channels (for instance from HR, Finance, Payroll…)
4.	If there are n departments in the organization, then there will be n*(n-1)/2 inter-departmental channels automatically created.
5.	Chat rooms: individuals/group chats
6.	Conference rooms: attendance marked/time calculated
7.	Video calls
8.	NLP: Natural language processing (machine learning): voice trigger input => speech to text and text to speech; so it’ll be a conversational chat going on.. ( This might be of use in Avatarify Project)
9.	All chats will be monitored except “The gossip section” which will be opened up during the lunch hours only.. and then it closes and shuts down… and no messages are recorded or saved.. So any important conversation must be noted down or done through official channel only.. It’s saved only for that session… and deleted forever.. like no memory.. it’s like a game where there is no progress saved..
